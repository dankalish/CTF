Go to the website on port 80
`http://10.129.244.217/login.php`

#### Check for valid usernames using wfuzz

- find the username "tyler"

```
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -d "username=FUZZ&password=password" --hs "No account found with that username." -u http://10.129.244.217/login.php
```

#### Create a new user and Login

Clicking around, you find the change password API on the page does not include verifying your old password, so that could be exploited later.

- If the request is changed from a POST to a GET, you can change the password.

#### Create a note and add \<center\> tags to the content of the pages

#### Notes and their content are centered. HTML is not sanitized at all, so website is vulnerable to XSS
